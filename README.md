Some of the problems I faced were addressing the value of aces in blackjack. They can be either 1s or 11s, but I did not know how to address that, and change the value of a previously acquired ace, so I set the value of aces to be 11. 
I also did not know how to split hands into two upon receiving two of the same cards initially, and ended up leaving that mechanic out.
I also had trouble running the code on visual code studio, as it was running fine on eclipse, but the code studio would not let me run SavitchIn and said there were some problems and syntax errors with my code, so I tried my best to find a work around that may work.
